The interfaces package contains various types of examples.
My Udemy course instructor provided Factory 1, 2, 3, and Flyers.
I completed the remaining examples.
Each one has a README file; you can check them.
At this point, I'm truly enjoying studying Java, including interfaces, abstract classes, etc., which motivate me to work on examples.
While I haven't built an application yet, learning about designs and developing their basic "backend" code helps me learn Java..
