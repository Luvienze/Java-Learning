This is an example from my Udemy course.

There are two interfaces, MathFunction and Calculator.

The MathFunction interface defines two methods: getName(), which returns a String, and calculate(), which takes a parameter arg and returns a double.

Several classes, including Sin, Cos, Squared, Square, Cubing, Log, and SumOfFib, implement the MathFunction interface.

The Calculator interface contains three methods: addFunction, which takes a function as a parameter, listMathFunction, 
which returns void, and doCalculation, which takes a functionName and a double argument and returns a double.

The CalculatorT1 class implements the Calculator interface and performs calculations there.

I added the Squared, Cubing, and SumOfFib classes to this example, while the other code was provided by the instructor."
