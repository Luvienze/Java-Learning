There is a registration office example in Java.
The parent class is 'Student', and 'Graduate', 'Vocational', and 'Undergraduate' are child classes.
Additionally, 'GraduateStudent' is the parent class, and 'PhD' and 'MasterStudent' are child classes of 'GraduateStudent'.
The 'RegistrationOffice' class has two methods in its constructor: one to get a student and another to register the student.
registerStudent is an example of downcasting, where instanceof is used.
getAStudent is an example of upcasting, creating new class objects with upcasting.
The 'Test' class is the main class where all objects/classes are called on the 'RegistrationOffice' object.
