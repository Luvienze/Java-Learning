We can represent a point on two dimensional level with Point class.
There are four class methods in Point class.
getCalculateRangeToOrigin is for calculating distance bewteen origin and point.
getCalculateBetweenThePoints is for calculating distanve between two points.
getClone is for cloning the given point.
move is for moving the point.
PointTest is my main method's class.

NOTE: We can calculate the distance between the points with one methods but it was a exercise to creating two methods for this.
Simply we can assing x1 and y1 to zero and calculate the distance between origin and point.
