University repo costed a lot time from me but it really help me to understand encapsulation.
I changed a lot things in all classes. Also how i can say it but i "downgrade" or "debuff" idk somethings to solve encapsulation in this repo.
The downgrade is i erased arrays in methods.It tooked a lot time to write and match arrays so i erased them to write and understand.Now we go on.

General Changes:
1) I changed all public variables including Class variables to public.
2) We declarate variables with set methods.
3) We don't use get method to access variables and methods.
->3.1) Instead of using get, I named them print... and they call the Classes' methods.
4) Other things are still same with minor changes.
