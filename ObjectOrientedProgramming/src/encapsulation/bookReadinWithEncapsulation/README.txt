I changed a lot things in this example and i'll explain it. Also I can compare with previous one.
Let's start author class.
1) All variables are private now.
2) I used set methods to declaration.
3) Now we can access and print variables without using get methods.
4) In previous code, Ä±sAlive returns false and true but with minor changes now it prints "alive" or "rip".
5) Also we can print all of author's infos in single method i called printAuthotInfo by using this().

Changes on Book class:
1) All variables are private now.
2) I used set methods to declaration.
3) Now we can access and print variables without using get methods.
4) Also we can print all of book's infos in single method i called printBookInfo by using this().
5) We can print reader's info too in single method i called printReaderInfo(9) by using this().
6) In previous code, bookCover returns false and true but with minor changes now it prints "hardcovered" or "softcovered".
7) I made a mistake about read() method on previous one. The book object read itself in previous code but actually reader should be able to read the book.
->7.1) To solve the problem i didn't change the old method in Book class. I'll explain it Reader class.

Changes on Reader class:
1) All variables are private now.
2) I uses set methods to declaration.
3) Now we can access and print variables without using get methods.
4) Also we can print all of reader's infos in single method i called printReaderInfo by using this().
5) To solve the read() method problem I declarate private int read in this class.
->5.1)I created read method in reader clas (as it should be).
->5.2)In read method, it calls book.printReadPage with read (which mean page) parameter.

Changes on ReaderTest class:
1) There are no changes actually but i extend the examples. 
2) I didn't use Scanner but imported it so if you want you can declarate names etc.
