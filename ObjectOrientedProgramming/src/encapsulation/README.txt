I learned encapsulation and practiced on my previous codes which they book reading, university and point.
It took me a lot days understand encapsulation with java and code it but at the end i finally finished it.
I'm still searching on different sources and youtube channels to learning more about encapsulation.
I explained each code in readme files in folders.
