I finally started the oop with Java. 
Next codes will be in this repo but i'll update the basics of Java.
Except the encapsulation and inheritance folders, the left ones were first steps to OOP.
I updated them a lot and I didn't delete the old versions.
Except the calcualtor, whiich I will update it too, they have better versions in encapsulation folder.
I'm learning and practising inheritance after I learned encapsulation. I uploaded some examples in there.
When i understand and build some examples etc about inheritance, I'll upload next folder and notify it.
